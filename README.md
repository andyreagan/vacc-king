VACC King
============

Just for fun, a twitter bot that tweets the VACC user who is using the most jobs if it's someone new.
It was called the VACC Hog...but that's not as fun.
It should be a goal!

Inspired by testing various python libraries with the twitter REST API.
Set up to check every 15 minutes in cron (but it could be every minute, as the name suggests).
